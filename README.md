# Cluster computing with R for Social Scientists

This repository contains the code and presentation of the workshop on parallel computing & cluster computing using R in collaboration with SURF. More information & sign-up can be found on the website [here](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda/cluster-computing-for-social-scientists-with-r).

## Prerequisites
- Some `R` knowledge & experience :)
- `R`, minimum version `4.2.0` (download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- If you are on Windows: `RTools` (download [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/))
- Recommended IDE: `RStudio` (download [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
- Install the following packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("Rcpp", "tidyverse", "pbapply", "sf", "mgcv"))
  ```
- Download this repository ([link](https://github.com/sodascience/ossc_workshop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) and unzip it to a nice location
- Open the project by double-clicking on `ossc_workshop.Rproj` in the folder.

## End result: a map of the Netherlands
The below map would take around 6 months to produce using the na√Øve implementation on a normal computer. You will learn how to compute it in a few hours on a supercomputer.
